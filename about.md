# About Vagrant

Vagrant is a free and open source project. The vision of the project
is to create a tool to transparently manage all the complex parts
of modern development within a virtual environment without affecting
the everyday workflow of the developer too much.

Vagrant was started on [January 21, 2010](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/commit/050bfd9c686b06c292a9614662b0ab1bbf652db3)
by [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://github.com/mitchellh) and
[John Bender](http://johnbender.us/). The first release of Vagrant
soon followed with version 0.1.0 being released on
[March 7, 2010](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/commit/296f234b50440b81adc8b75160591e199572d06d).

Today, Vagrant is considered stable and is used by many thousands
of people worldwide. The vision of Vagrant is still unchanged, and
continues to move towards an ambitious goal of moving all development
into virtualized environments by making it easier to do so than not
to. Additionally, work is ongoing to have Vagrant run identically
on every major consumer OS platform (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows).

Vagrant development is not backed by any single company, and developers
work on Vagrant on their own free time. Much of the work and help towards
developing Vagrant is thanks to generous [contributions](/contribute/index.html).
