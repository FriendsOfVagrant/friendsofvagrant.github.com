# Contribute Code

If you're a developer that would like to contribute by fixing a
bug, or enchancing Vagrant in some way, then contributing a direct
code patch is your best option.

Unlike many other projects, Vagrant is not very strict on what
you change, the style of the code you write, or how you submit
your contributions. We value simply having contributions over
subtle technical details.

So, if you're not interested in reading anything and just
want to dive in the code, then go ahead and submit your patch.
But if you'd like your patch to make it through the process
quicker or you'd just like to feel more comfortable about
contributing to the project, then please read the various
pages about contributing code in the left navigation.
