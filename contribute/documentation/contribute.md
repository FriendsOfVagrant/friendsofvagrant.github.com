# Contribute Your Changes

Once you have made your changes and you're happy with them,
it is time to contribute them back so that they can be applied
to the real website.

Since you're just modifying code in a branch, then contributing
to the documentation is just like contributing to code: make
a pull request. GitHub has a [great guide on pull requests here](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).

If you're not comfortable enough with git to make a pull
request, please feel free to simply `diff` your work and open
a GitHub issue. Easy!
