# What does Vagrant use the money for?

Before contributing financially to anything, it is important to know
what this money will be used for and whether it will help at all. This
page goes over the current costs of Vagrant as well as what any excess
money will go towards.

Of course, if you're ever concerned that the money won't be used
properly, feel free to contact us and we'll be happy to talk with you
about it.

## Current Costs

The following items are things which are paid for now that relate to
Vagrant:

* Hosting - While this website is hosted for free via [GitHub](https://github.com),
  the costs for hosting boxes (each of which is around 400+ MB) is around $100
  per month. The [Vagrant CI](http://ci.vagrantup.com) costs around $80 per year.
* CI Machines - All the [Vagrant CI](http://ci.vagrantup.com) machines are donated
  or were purchased for Vagrant. The costs for these are around $3,500 total.
* Conference Travel - A reasonable amount of travel is done to evangelize
  Vagrant and explain the benefits of using the tool. This raises awareness
  about Vagrant and also provides a place for many companies to speak with
  Vagrant developers face-to-face in order to evaluate the technology for
  their own environments.

## Future Costs

In addition to the above, there are many things that Vagrant would like
to do in the future that would incur additional costs. Some of these things
are enumerated below, however this list is constantly in flux.

* Additonal hypervisors - We see Vagrant as a tool that can support more
  than just VirtualBox: KVM, VMWare fusion, VMWare vSphere, etc. In order
  to develop for these platforms, we need machines that can run them,
  not only for development but for automated testing as well. Costs:
  anywhere from hundreds to thousands of US dollars.
* Additional CI Machines - Vagrant relies on a [CI system](http://ci.vagrantup.com)
  to continually run tests against as many platforms that Vagrant supports
  as possible. Currently, there is subpar coverage of platforms in our
  test machine matrix and we'd love to add more. Costs: Thousands of US dollars.
* Public box hosting - Currently members of the community are expected
  to host their own boxes they want to share with the public. Vagrant would
  like to offer an official source of Vagrant boxes. This requires
  hosting costs for both a website as well as the box files, which will
  incur many terabytes of bandwidth per month. Costs: Hundreds of US dollars
  per month.
