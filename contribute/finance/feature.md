# Pay for a Feature or Bug Fix

Vagrant development is done completely by individuals in their
free time. Because of this there is no obligation to ever complete
specific feature requests or fix certain bugs (although we try to
do as much as we can).

If there is a specific feature or bug that you or your company
wishes to be fixed, you are able to pay a bounty for this feature.
This cost is generally used to pay for developer time rather than
actual physical needs of the project (such as CI machines or so on),
although the money will most certainly go towards that. But because
of this, and because a result is expected rather quickly out of a
bounty, the cost is much greater.

The exact time it would take for what you need to be done depends
entirely on what you'd like as well as how much you're willing to pay.
Cost and payment is determined on a per-feature basis. Please contact
