# Contribute to Vagrant Financially

Vagrant hosting, development costs, travel costs when speaking at
conferences, testing machine costs, etc. are all out of pocket or
contributed by 3rd parties. To be honest, the costs for running and
developing Vagrant are not too great! If you can contribute in some other
way, that is typically more helpful. However, for some companies using
Vagrant or individuals who want to contribute, financial options are
the easiest/best choice for them, and any donations will be used
for the project.

This section of the website explains what money received for Vagrant
is used for as well as provide options for donating financially to
the Vagrant project.

Please use the navigation on the left to learn about various details
of contributing to Vagrant financially.
