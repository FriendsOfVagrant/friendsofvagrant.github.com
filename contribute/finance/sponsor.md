# Sponsor Vagrant

If you or your organization donates enough money, we'll show our
thanks by calling you a sponsor!

## Version Sponsor

If you pay for a specific feature or bug fix, your sponsorship will
be noted in the version release that your feature or bug fix is released.
This will include:

* Your name and link to your site in the release email. This will
  be towards the top of the email.
* Your name and link to your site in the tweet about the release.
* Your name and link to your site in the release announcement
  on this website. This will be towards the top of the page.

## Project Sponsor

A higher level of sponsorship is to be a project sponsor. Project
sponsors dedicate a certain amount consistently to the project. The
amount does not need to be great, but it needs to be available
at a regular cadence. Project sponsors are the companies which
keep Vagrant reliably running at all times. Since donations are not predictable,
it is hard to keep systems running based solely on donations alone.
Project sponsorships, however, are predictable and regular, so they
keep all parts of Vagrant running smoothly.

Project sponsors have the following benefits:

* Logo and link on the [About Vagrant](/about.html) page.
* Logo and link on the website in every release announcement
  during the time of the sponsorship.
* Logo and verbal thanks at any talks given by a Vagrant developer
  on any topic which includes Vagrant.

Note that the benefits above will be scaled relative to your
sponsorship amount, and are subject to change. The exact terms of
the sponsorship will be determined when the sponsorship is established.

If you're interested in sponsoring Vagrant as an ongoing project,
please contact [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://github.com/mitchellh) at
`mitchell.hashimoto@gmail.com`.
