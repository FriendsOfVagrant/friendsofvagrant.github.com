# Contribute to Vagrant

First, <strong>thank you</strong> for being interested in contributing

behind Vagrant happens from a variety of individuals in their free time.
For this reason, contributions in any way are greatly welcome and are the
main driving factor for the success of Vagrant today.

Often with technical tools, a "contribution" is thought to be a code
contribution, but there are many other ways that one may contribute to
the project. This section is meant to outline the various ways that
contributions are welcome and to help make you feel comfortable and
productive in contributing to this project.

The various methods of contributing to Vagrant are linked in the
