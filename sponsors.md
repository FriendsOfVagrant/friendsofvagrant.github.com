# Vagrant Project Sponsors

While Vagrant is free and open source, Vagrant is not free
to support or develop. For consistent support of the
Vagrant project, the following companies deserve special
recognition. These companies consistently provide resources which
allow the Vagrant project to run smoothly by supporting
hosting costs, providing testing machines, sponsoring travel
to speak at conferences, etc.
