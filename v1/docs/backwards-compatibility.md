<h1 class="top">Backwards Compatibility Promise</h1>

Vagrant has set high goals for itself: to change the way web
developers work. But we know that to achieve that, it needs to be
a stable and reliable tool. One of our main goals is that you should
be able to go back to a Vagrant powered project a year later and still
be able to build its environment as if it were made the same day. To
accomplish this we need to settle on a standard API and configuration
specification.

With that in mind, our promise is to provide backwards compatibility
for every major version of Vagrant. For example, once Vagrant 1.0 is
released, we promise to support that version forever (one way or another).

It is a bold statement, one which we’re sure will introduce significant
development challenges in the future, but we’re committed to it.
