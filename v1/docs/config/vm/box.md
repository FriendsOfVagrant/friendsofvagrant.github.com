# config.vm.box

Configuration key: `config.vm.box`

Default value: `nil`

Every Vagrant virtual machine is built from a base image. In Vagrant,
these are distributed as "boxes." This configuration option specifies
the logical name of the box for the VM to be built against. The logical
name is the name used when calling `vagrant box add`.
